King Philip Auguste ordered the construction of the city walls and fortifications, and the population continued to increase, becoming the power center of the kingdom. The city’s trade and handicraft workshops were gradually concentrated on the right bank of the Seine and the market began to form. Most of the educational, academic and religious circles live on the left bank of the Seine. Paris became a center for the creation of illuminated manuscripts and the birthplace of Gothic architecture. Despite civil wars, the plague, and foreign occupation, Paris became the most populous city in the Western world during the Middle Ages.

    <p>The first Industrial Revolution lead to a large number of labours gathering in Paris.
    Osman launched a large-scale planning of the city of Paris with a group of architects, planning experts and water experts. The core of the Paris transformation plan developed by Osman is the planning and construction of the trunk road network. The large number of old buildings are demolished, and a spacious avenue is opened by cutting the cake. The tall trees are planted on both sides to become the boulevard. Osman strictly regulates the height and form of buildings on both sides of the road, emphasizes the continuity of the horizontal line of streetscapes, and consciously creates urban landscapes. After the renovation, Paris formed a single-center, radial traffic network, with the main axis parallel to the Seine.

To provide shelter for people, in just ten years, Paris has built a 10,000-hectare residential area in the suburbs, almost equal to the urban area. Because of the rush of construction, the equipment is poor and the living conditions are poor. It was under this circumstance that the French government made up its mind to start two large-scale planning and renovations for the Greater Paris area in 1961 and 1968 respectively. However, since 1970, the political and economic institutions of France, which had been excessively concentrated in the capital, were suspended, the development of Paris was suspended.</p>
